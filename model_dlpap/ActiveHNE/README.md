This program (ActiveHNE) implements an active learning for heterogeneous network embedding, as proposed in the following paper.

The codes of ActiveHNE are implemented and tested on Tensorflow 1.8.0 version.
The code of DHNE of ActiveHNE is prepared with reference to the original GCN source code.

============== *** Input data *** ==============

An example: 
       node_index = ["directors_dict.txt", "movies_dict.txt", "tags_dict.txt", "users_dict.txt", "writers_dict.txt"]
       edge_index = ["movie_director.txt", "movie_tag.txt", "movie_writer.txt", "user_movie_rating.txt"]
       label_index = ["movie_genre.txt"]
       train_label_index = ["movie_genre_train_idx.txt"]
       test_label_index = ["movie_genre_test_idx.txt"]

In order to use your own data, you have to first divide the original heterogeneous network into homogeneous networks and bipartite networks, and provide:

node_index: 
            the .txt files that store the indexes of nodes. Each file stores the indexes of nodes with respect to a particular node type (an HIN has more than one node types)  
            NOTE: all nodes in the HIN has a unique index. If there are N nodes in the HIN, the index of nodes ranges from [0, N-1]
edge_index:
           the .txt files that store the relationships (or edges) between nodes: each file stores the relationships between nodes in a particular divided network. 
           (an heterogeneous network has been divided into homogeneous networks and bipartite networks)
            an example:  "index_of_node_1"\t"index_of_node_2"\t"edge_weight" (for weighted networks) or "index_of_node_1"\t"index_of_node_2" (for unweighted networks)
			â€œindex_of_node_1" and "index_of_node_2" represent the indexes of two nodes, respectively. NOTE: "\t" is used as the separator, 	   
label_index:
		   a .txt file that stores the indexes of all labeled nodes. 
           NOTE: The labeled nodes here just mean the nodes with labels in the dataset, not the labeled nodes used for semi-supervised model training after data division. 
train_label_index: 
                 a .txt file that stores the indexes of 50% labeled nodes (randomly selected from "label_index"). It includs the 25% nodes of training set and the 25% nodes of validation set.
                 an example:  "index_of_node"\t"label"				 
test_label_index:
                 a .txt file that stores the indexes of 50% labeled nodes (randomly selected from "label_index") used for testing (test set).
                 an example:  "index_of_node"\t"label"
